            <h2 id="innerHead">Introduction</h2>
            <h3 id="paraHead">Why this Blog, and Why Now?</h3>
            <p id="par1">You have probably stumbled across this website through some random rabbit-hole that has taken you on a path through the greatest of human highs to the deepest lows that life can serve you. I applaud you, and I thank you. I'm writing this blog as a daily journal to my life in Kamakura city, situated around 60km to the south-west of Tokyo city in Japan. I have moved here recently, and I need to learn about my new town, albeit I have been here for tour guide work many times before. This blog is the best way for recording the new sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and sites, of this new town.</p>
            <h3 id="paraHead">Why Read On?</h3>
            <p id="par2">The short answer is: don't. But there are also other ways to think about stumbling across knowledge. History is littered with tales of human beings recklessly stubbing their toes against the hard realities of new information. This just happens to be one of those opportunities. Maybe, for example, you may end up living in Kamakura in the future. Maybe you have never been here and never plan to do so. The latter is a better reason to read this blog. You can tick off some minor area of the world that you will never visit anyway and, should anyone ever mutter the word "Kamakura" to you at a party, or a wedding, or a wake, you will have a topic, a sentence, an image with which to respond. After all, why learn anything?</p>
