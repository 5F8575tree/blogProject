            <h3 id="paraHead">How did I find myself in one of Kamakura's most delicious ramen restaurants?</h3>
            <p class="par" id="par1">Since moving to Kamakura city from central Tokyo towards the last remaining days of 2021, I have been enjoying the moments I have to walk in nature, even if it just means taking a new and longer route as I pick my son up from school each day. These short wanders have struck me twice with interesting new realities about my surroundings. Firstly, Tokyo air smells bad. It isn't that Tokyo has a pollution problem in any way at all, in fact it is remarkably clean for one of the world's largest and most densely-populated cities. Rather, it suffers from a lack of pure, unadulterated, fresh air. It is a wonderful feeling to drink in fresh air. Akin to taking down half a bottle of water after a hike, or during a hangover.</p>

            <p class="par" id="par2">The second thing I have discovered is that Kamakura has an abundance of fresh vegetables available for excellent prices. The reason? The local people are growing tons and tons of vegetables in city-block-size areas of land amongst the town. They do this more as a hobby than even a side hustle. One greenhouse nearby has a vending machine stacked with fresh vegetables. A recent morning, a local was bringing down broccoli as I was sitting drinking a coffee outside. He began to stock the vending machine, and we started chatting. An interesting fellow, he had once lived in California when he was 20 years old, back during the Bubble Era (1980's, principally). He told me he felt that more young Japanese should go abroad, even if it just to work on a farm, in order to create memories.</p>

            <p class="par" id="par3">As I realised I should leave and get back home to start some work, he invited me to lunch later that day. Sure, for how else can I find out where the locals eat?</p>
            <h3 id="paraHead2">So, how was the food?</h3>
            <p class="par" id="par4">Having been spoiled by living in Tokyo for eight-years, I rarely come across a new restaurant that I feel could not be matched by anything in Tokyo, but Restaurant #1 certainly had me wondering. The counter was bare and simple, and the familiar rench of ramen broth was appetising, yet equaly nauseating. Do you ever think that ramen has a pungent, violent aroma? The best places will allow the broth to sit for days. Tastes great though and, after all is said, what is ramen if it isn't a guilty pleasure?</p>
